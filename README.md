![Boat Attack!](http://gdurl.com/6ISqD)

This Unity project has been created to aid the testing and development of LWRP. The project is a small vertical slice of a boat racing game, complete with raceable boats and island environment.

**Project Features**:
  * Uses LWRP(Lightweight Render Pipeline) from Unity
  * Mobile optimized, low poly, LODs, no compute
  * C# Jobs buoyancy system
  * Cinemachine camera setups
  * Shadergraph usage
  * Custom LWRP pass injection for water and planar reflections
  * Gestner based water system
  * Much more..

# Usage
Currently this is a full project so you should jsut need to clone* down and open in Unity, if you stick to the master branch it should always work with the latest publicly available Unity and assorted packages.

Feel free to post any issues, but know this is a 'as is' repo, it's meant more for discovery of how some of the LWRP features work and a learning resource for some tricks. Also it's used for checking new features and stablility for in development branches of LWRP.
